# Complete Guide: SQL-to-Kotlin Data Class Generator with Type Safety

## Phase 1: Basic SQL Parser Foundation

### Step 1: Create SQL Table Information Models
- Create data structures to represent SQL table metadata
- Need a `SQLTableInfo` class containing table name and list of columns
- Need a `SQLColumnInfo` class containing column name, SQL type, nullable flag, primary key flag, and optional default value
- These will be the foundation for all code generation

### Step 2: Build SQL Parser Engine
- Create a parser that can read `.sql` files and extract `CREATE TABLE` statements
- Use regex patterns to match table creation syntax: `CREATE TABLE tablename (...)`
- Parse column definitions within parentheses, handling common SQL syntax
- Extract column names, types (VARCHAR, INTEGER, etc.), and constraints (NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY)
- Handle basic SQL variations like `IF NOT EXISTS` and different spacing
- Skip constraint definitions like `FOREIGN KEY` and `CONSTRAINT` clauses
- Convert parsed information into the table/column data structures

### Step 3: Create KSP Processor Foundation
- Build a KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) processor that runs during compilation
- Accept configuration options like SQL file path and target package name
- Read the SQL file using the parser and convert to table metadata
- Generate one Kotlin file per SQL table found
- Handle file creation through KSP's CodeGenerator API

## Phase 2: Basic Data Class Generation

### Step 4: SQL Type to Kotlin Type Mapping
- Create mapping logic from SQL types to Kotlin types
- Map common types: VARCHAR/TEXT → String, INTEGER → Int, BIGINT → Long, BOOLEAN → Boolean
- Handle nullable columns by adding `?` to Kotlin types (except primary keys)
- Use kotlinx-datetime types: TIMESTAMP → Instant, DATE → LocalDate, TIME → LocalTime
- Include fallback to String for unknown SQL types

### Step 5: Generate Serializable Data Classes
- Generate Kotlin data classes with `@Serializable` annotation
- Convert SQL table names to PascalCase class names (users → Users)
- Convert SQL column names to camelCase property names (user_name → userName)
- Add `@SerialName` annotations when property names differ from column names
- Include proper imports for kotlinx.serialization and kotlinx.datetime
- Add documentation comments indicating source SQL table

### Step 6: Handle Naming Conventions
- Implement snake_case to camelCase conversion for property names
- Keep class names in PascalCase
- Preserve original SQL names in SerialName annotations
- Handle edge cases like consecutive underscores or numbers in names

## Phase 3: Column Constants and Metadata

### Step 7: Generate Table Metadata Objects
- For each table, generate a companion object or separate object with table metadata
- Include `TABLE_NAME` constant with the original SQL table name
- Create nested `Columns` object with constants for each column name
- Generate typed `Column<T>` references for each column with correct Kotlin types
- This provides compile-time safety for column name references

### Step 8: Create Column Type Wrapper
- Define a `Column<T>` value class that wraps column names with type information
- This enables type-safe operations while keeping runtime overhead minimal
- The generic type parameter ensures operations match the expected column type

## Phase 4: Type-Safe Query Building

### Step 9: Build Query Builder Foundation
- Create a `TypeSafeQuery<T>` class that builds SQL queries with type safety
- Maintain internal lists of WHERE conditions and parameters
- Provide methods like `where(column, value)` that accept typed Column references
- Ensure the column type matches the value type at compile time

### Step 10: Implement Common Query Operations
- Add `where` method for equality conditions
- Add `whereIn` method for IN clauses with lists of values
- Add `build` method that generates SQL string and parameter list
- Handle parameter placeholders (`?`) correctly for prepared statements
- Support method chaining for fluent API usage

### Step 11: Generate Query Helpers
- For each generated data class, create query builder factory methods
- Provide easy access to typed column references through the table metadata
- Enable queries like `TypeSafeQuery<Users>().where(Users.username, "john")`

## Phase 5: Validation and Constraints

### Step 12: Extract SQL Constraints
- Enhance the SQL parser to detect common constraints from column definitions
- Identify NOT NULL constraints, PRIMARY KEY markers, and length limits from VARCHAR(n)
- Extract DEFAULT values where present
- Store constraint information in the column metadata

### Step 13: Generate Validation Annotations
- Create custom annotations for common constraints: `@NotNull`, `@MaxLength`, `@Email`, `@PrimaryKey`
- Add these annotations to generated data class properties based on SQL constraints
- Include the annotations in the generated code imports

### Step 14: Create Validation Logic
- Generate companion object methods for data class validation
- Create `validate()` functions that check constraints and return error lists
- Implement basic validation rules: length checks, null checks, simple format validation
- Return structured validation errors with field names and messages

## Phase 6: Relationship Mapping

### Step 15: Detect Foreign Key Patterns
- Analyze column names to identify foreign key relationships
- Use naming conventions: columns ending in `_id` (except `id` itself) likely reference other tables
- Attempt to match referenced table names by removing `_id` suffix and pluralizing
- Store relationship information during parsing phase

### Step 16: Generate Relationship Helpers
- Create extension functions or helper objects for navigating relationships
- Generate methods like `message.user()` that return appropriate query builders
- Create reverse relationships like `user.messages()` for one-to-many associations
- Ensure all relationship methods return type-safe query builders

### Step 17: Validate Relationships
- During compilation, check that inferred foreign key relationships reference existing tables
- Report warnings or errors for orphaned foreign key references
- Validate that relationship methods will work with the generated schema

## Phase 7: Schema Validation

### Step 18: Implement Schema Consistency Checks
- Validate that all tables have primary keys defined
- Check foreign key references point to existing tables
- Verify that relationship patterns make sense (no circular dependencies)
- Ensure column names don't conflict with Kotlin keywords

### Step 19: Generate Compilation Warnings/Errors
- Use KSP's logger to report schema issues during compilation
- Provide helpful error messages with table and column context
- Allow compilation to continue for warnings, but fail for critical errors
- Include suggestions for fixing common schema problems

## Phase 8: Migration Support

### Step 20: Generate Migration Metadata
- Create migration classes that represent the current schema state
- Include both UP and DOWN migration scripts
- Version migrations based on schema hash or explicit versioning
- Generate migration runner utilities for applying schema changes

### Step 21: Schema Comparison Utilities
- Provide tools to compare generated schema with previous versions
- Detect added/removed tables and columns
- Generate appropriate migration scripts for schema evolution
- Handle common migration patterns safely

## Phase 9: Integration and Optimization

### Step 22: Optimize Generated Code
- Minimize generated file size by avoiding redundant imports
- Use efficient Kotlin constructs (value classes, inline functions where appropriate)
- Ensure generated code follows Kotlin coding conventions
- Add proper formatting and documentation

### Step 23: Error Handling and Debugging
- Provide clear error messages when SQL parsing fails
- Include line numbers and context for SQL syntax errors
- Generate helpful comments in output code indicating source locations
- Add debug logging options for troubleshooting generation issues

### Step 24: Configuration and Customization
- Allow configuration of naming conventions (snake_case vs camelCase preferences)
- Support custom type mappings for specific SQL types
- Enable/disable specific features through processor options
- Allow custom package names and output directories

## Key Design Principles

**Simplicity First**: Each feature should solve a specific problem without over-engineering
**Compile-Time Safety**: Catch errors during compilation rather than runtime
**Convention Over Configuration**: Use sensible defaults based on common SQL patterns
**Incremental Adoption**: Each feature can be used independently
**Clear Error Messages**: When something goes wrong, make it obvious how to fix it
**Minimal Runtime Overhead**: Generate efficient code that doesn't impact application performance

This approach provides significant type safety improvements over raw SQL strings while remaining much simpler than full SQL parsing solutions like SQLDelight. The generated code is readable, maintainable, and provides excellent IDE support with autocompletion and compile-time error checking.
